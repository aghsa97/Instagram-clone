# Instagram-clone from Scratch Using React, Tailwind CSS and Firebase
# ðŸ“£ Summary

This single page app (instagram-clone) was built using react (Custom Hooks and context), firebase firestore and tailwind css.

I enjoyed using the custom hooks and context in react due to its appility to get the data easly from the parents components
and the hooks allowed me to handle the life-cickle of the componenets without any complitcations.

Tailwind css is really fun and easy to use. Setting up Tailwind can be a bit hard but once everything is satup you will enjoy
styling and builing your own components. (It can help you a lot in case your building a responsive app).

there are four main pages (Sign up, sign in, dashboard and profile page) some are public and some are private with auth listeners. 
Firebase firestore handles all the data, and that data is retrieved using a custom hook.

Unfortulnitly i did no testing in this app.
